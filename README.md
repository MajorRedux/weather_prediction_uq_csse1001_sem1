# weather_prediction_uq_csse1001_sem1
weather prediction in python

"""
Simple Weather Prediction program in Python that reads user inputs and predicts weather based on a .CSV file. 

This was assessment piece 2 of UQ CSSE1001 - Introduction to Software Engineering.

If you are a student and are looking for code/help for your assignment, DO NOT COPY ANY CODE. I cannot stress this enough.
Universities implement clever algorithms to check your code and if you do the ol' copy/paste you are going to get caught.
Furthermore, if you don't understand the code and can replicate it yourself you will fail the final exam anyway, so take 
the time to understand how the code works and how you can utilise it in your own project/assessment.

That is all.
